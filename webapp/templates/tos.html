            platform that utilizes advanced technologies to assist users in identifying potential medical conditions
            based
            on provided symptoms. With an intuitive interface, users can create their own accounts and then enter their
            symptoms in a chat environment. At the core of DoctorGPT is a powerful model trained on extensive medical
            datasets. These datasets enable the model to establish connections between entered symptoms and possible
            diseases, making it a valuable resource for users seeking insight into their health status. With DoctorGPT,
            our
            goal is to provide an accessible source of health information, allowing users to quickly and easily gain
            insights into potential health issues.</p>

                    the

                    or
                    provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal
                    Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                    obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
                    delay, or
                    failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
                    provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision
                    or
